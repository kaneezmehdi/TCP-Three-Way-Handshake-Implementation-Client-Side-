About the code:

This client.cpp program implements a TCP client that performs a 3-way handshake
 with a server using raw sockets, manually constructing IP and TCP headers. 
 This low-level approach demonstrates how TCP connections are established at the network protocol level.

 Prereqisites:

- Operating System: macOS or Linux (raw sockets require a Unix-like system)
- Compiler: g++ or clang++
- Root privileges (required to send raw packets)

COMPILATION:
bash
g++ client.cpp -o client -std=c++11

EXECUTION:

1. Run the Server
In one terminal window, start the server to listen for incoming SYN packets:
bash:
  sudo make run-server
 2. Run the Client
In another terminal window, initiate the TCP handshake from the client side
bash:
 sudo make run-client
